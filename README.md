# DeviceTrackingApplication
This is a python CLI based Device Tracking Application 
<br>
#**How This Project Started**
One night I visited a relative’s house where a young woman who sells goods lost her phone. They had the phone number but no practical, low-cost way to locate the device. Many people in our community can’t afford official tracking services, and native solutions either require vendor access or a paid law-enforcement process. That incident made me ask: can we build a simple, robust, Python-only CLI tool that helps ordinary people track their own devices they enrolled earlier — without needing a rich or centralized service? <br>

This project began from that question. Its goal is to enable individuals to register and monitor their own laptops/desktops (and advanced Termux-capable Androids) via a lightweight Python agent, a coordinating server, and a single command-line admin tool. It’s intended for consenting devices only — to assist everyday people recover devices, produce evidence for authorities, and reduce dependency on expensive third-party tracking services.
